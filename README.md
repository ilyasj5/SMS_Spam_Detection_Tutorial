Followed the tutorial https://kopilov-vlad.medium.com/detect-sms-spam-in-kaggle-with-scikit-learn-5f6afa7a3ca2 
and developed a machine learning based SMS-spam detector using scikit-learn library in Python. Leveraged various 
classification algorithms and text vectorization techniques to train models on a dataset of SMS messages labeled 
as spam or non-spam.
